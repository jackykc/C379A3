- some synchronization toy problem, implement in either monitors or semaphores

- mutual exclusion examples (that fail most of the time)

- test and set as building blocks for semaphore/locks

- interrupt usage for mutual exclusion

- fork (tracing examples)

- CPU scheduling (draw little box diagrams -> a segmented rectangle?)

- memory layout of processes in the vein of ELF

- virtual memory LRU/FCFS (heres a trace of references, what do i have in the beginning? what do I have in the end?)

- count page faults (usually involves worst case) (page boundary? if multi-byte)
can be piece of code

- file systems 
	on-disk representation
	(a file has that many bytes, how many blocks does it require etc)

- file system (unix specific)
	inode
	links

- deadlock 
	safe/unsafe ?
	detection

- what is a system call? why, how is it invoked, arguments, blocks?

- disk scheduling
	SSJF
	Elevator
	C-seek

- virtual machine
	special instructions
	memory management (shadow tables)

- TLB
	mechanism
	trace to see whats happening
	CACHE

- queue
	bottlenecks
	stability condition
	(do not need to memorize formulas)
	response time
